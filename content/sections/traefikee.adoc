* And boom, sold, kthx bye.

== What a company wants from a reverse proxy ?

* Reliability
* Security
* Full support
* All the features from Traefik !
* Scalability

== So we made Traefik distributed !

[.notes]
--
* TraefikEE is a cluster of traefik instances working together.
* You operate your cluster of reverse proxies as it is one instance.
** Exit rsyncing your certificates and your configuration between your clusters.

* TraefikEE is at the edge of your infrastructure
* Separation of concerns
* Control plane gets the configuration and pushes to the data plane
* Data plane is where the data flows
* Gain on reliability, each component can be redunded.
* Gain on security, now the control plane is isolated from the outside traffic.
* Gain on scalability, each component is scalable.
--

== And there is more !

* No restart needed to configure the proxy
* Backup and restore system
* Distributed features out of the box
** Let's encrypt support
** Rate limiting (1.1)
** Max connections (1.1)
** Circuit breaker (1.2)

* TEE is still young, we setup up the foundations, now we're building on them.

== All included into a single binary

(No need of an external key value store)

== Actually, there is another binary

`traefikeectl` our CLI

* Installs TraefikEE automatically on k8s and swarm
* Deploys configuration
* Get cluster informations
* Create backups
* Fetch the logs
